2015-11-11 Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Added focb argument to mrgsim function; default is TRUE, so that
	parameters in the first record data is carried back to the start of the
	simulation
	* Added methods with signature ANY to as_bmat and as_dmat.
2015-10-08 Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Removed dependency on metrumrg.
	* Added requirement that records in the data set do not decrease
	in time within subject.
2015-09-11 Kyle Baron 	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Fixed parameter update mechanism when parameters are in data and
	first dose is at time > 0.
	* Added extended unit tests for bioavability functionality.
2015-09-4 Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Added capacity for arbitrary number of $CMT and $INIT blocks
	* Added $VCMT block: like $CMT except dxdt_CMT=0; added to $ODE
2015-09-02 Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg>
	* Fixed bug that appeared with recsort=1 (see ?mrgsim) and
	parameters were attached to a data dat; added parameter reset step
	to copy parameters from both idata and data for the first ID in
	the data set to ensure they are properly reset prior to
	simulating.
	* Fixed problem with recsort validation mechanism; was giving
	error when recsort was set to 2; fixed now.
0.4.001 Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg>
	* Removed restriction that addl is only implementd on dosing
	records with evid=1; it now applies to any record with evid !=0
0.4.000 Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Submitted for change request
0.3028	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
0.3027	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Version bump
0.3026	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* All double, int, and bool variables declared by the user in
	$MAIN, $ODE, or $TABLE have global scope by default
	* Changed to Rmd/html vignettes
	* Added new methods for omat and smat functions
	* Added cmat and bmat functions
	* Reconfigured code chunk handling for model spec
	* Added mrgsim method with signature "missing"
0.3025	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Version bump
0.3024	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Added global:: prefix to C++ variables that will get those
	variables declared and initialized in the global environment
	* Added obsonly and obsaug arguments to mrgsim
	* Several bug fixes: compartments were not properly initialized
	when the calculated initial value depended on a value from the
	"data" dataset; indexing problem for EPS(n) when an individual's record set
	ended with an infusion that terminated after the last observation.
0.3023	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* request is now kept in the model object as character; use "" to
	drop all compartments from output; vignettes, example, and demo
	code updated.
0.3022 	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Fixed bug when parsing model specification files; all lines
	starting with // or ## are dropped
	* Changed R CMD shlib to R CMD SHLIB when compiling the new model
	specification file
	* Adding $OMEGA, $SIGMA, $NMXML, $ENV blocks to new model
	specification format
	* Use mread to read, parse, compile and load a model in the new format
0.3021	Kyle		<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Version bump
0.3020 	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Increased default limit value on plot method for batch_mrgsims
	objects to 9.
	* Decreased default limit value on plot method for mrgsims objects
	to 16.
	* A warning is issued when variables (compartments or tabled
	output) are dropped from a plot because the number of variables
	exceeds the limit argument.
0.3019 	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Fixed bug in CALLINIT (mrgsolve.cpp) that failed to produce the
	calculated initial conditions from main block.
	* Add error (Rcpp::stop) when model parameters are writable and
	being reset from record to record and using a condensed data set.
	* Added unit tests to ensure that initial conditions are correctly
	calculated.
	* mtime values that are earlier than an individual's first
	observation or dosing record are dropped.
0.3018	Kyle Baron 	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Bumped run number for validation version.
0.3017	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Fixed modelspec documentation: SOLVERTIME is double, not
	integer
	* Added support for character cmt values in both data sets (idata
	and data) and events objects; valid cmt names are turned into the appropriate
	numeric value in the data set
	* A message is now issued if non-numeric columns are found in and
	dropped from the input data set
	* An error is generated if a non-numeric matrix is passed in for
	data or idata
	* Now exporting S3 generic mrgindata as well as methods for
	data.frame and matrix that does the work to drop non-numeric
	columns from input data sets as well as transitioning from
	character compartment name to integer value
	* Added getcmtn directive in attributes; if a compartment name is
	listed here, the integer compartment value is available as
	_N_<cmtname>
	* Created new contstructors for class Rodeproblem that allows
	constructor from param vector and init vector
0.3016  Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Added code argument to mrgmod; if provided, cpp_model is called
0.03015 Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>

0.03014	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Fixed bug involved in requesting only specific table items

0.3013	Kyle Baron	<kyleb@metrumrg.com>
	* Package in preparation for qualification
