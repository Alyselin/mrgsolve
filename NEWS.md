__Please see the latest release__: [v0.5.12](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/releases/tag/v0.5.12)

# Since 0.5.12

## Bugs fixed
* Fixed a bug where infusion dosing events with `evid 4` were not properly implemented.  While investigating that issue, also found similar issue with `evid 4` infusions getting scheduled with `addl` ([issue 31](../../issues/31)).
* Removed NSE evaluation for arguments passed into  `ev` to avoid unintended issues in evaluation ([issue 29](../../issues/29)).

## New features
* Added `mcode` function as alternative to using `mread` when your model is written in an `R` string.  Note the order of the arguments:
first `model`, then `code`, then `project`.  `project` defaults to `tempdir`.  So the call is: `mod <- mcode("mymodel", code)`.  The
equivalent `mread` call is: `mod <- mread("mymodel", tempdir(),code)`.
* `carry.out()` and `Req()` now take `newname = oldname` as input.  Use this syntax in `carry.out` when you want to copy a column from the input data set into the simulated data set, changing the column to `newname` from `oldname`.  Use this syntax in `Req` when you want to change the names of compartments or output variables spcified in `$TABLE` / `$CAPTURE`. 
* Added `pkmodel` function for easy loading and simulating from 1- and 2-compartment models ([issue 39])(../../issues/39).
* Added new code block: `$PKMODEL` for simulating PK model with analytical solutions.  The main option for this block is `ncmt`, which picks the number of compartments for the pk model.  See `?PKMODEL` for more information and other options ([issue 34](../../issues/34).

## Under the hood
* Added `code` attribute to `mrgmod` objects.  The actual source code stays with the model object. `see` was modified to look at `x@code` first when showing the model code.
* Added a tokenizer function (`get_tokens`, a wrapper for the boost tokenizer) to help checking the model specification file.
* Data items entered in `$FIXED` are now implemented as C++ preprocessor directives by default rather than `const double` variables.  Use `$SET fixed_type = "define"` or `$SET fixed_type = "const"` to select between the approaches.


# Since 0.5.11
## Bugs fixed
* Added missing example model specification files (popExample, viralExample, others)
* Added `mindt` attribute to `mrgmod` objects with default value of `.Machine$double.eps*10`. When the problem includes an infusion, the calculated end of the infusion
may come too close to another record.  Usually the solver will fail with the message `DLSODA- TOUT(=R1) too close to T(=R2) to start integration.`.  To fix this, set `mindt` to be greater than zero but small ... maybe 1E-12.  When `mindt` is greater than zero and `tto - tfrom` (the times of two adjacent records) is less than `mindt`, `mrgsolve` will set `tto` equal to `tfrom` ([issue 9](../../issues/9)).
* `zero.re` didn't properly update the `$SIGMA` list when one matrix was named and another was unnamed.  This has been fixed.  ([issue 16](../../issues/16))
* Fixed a bug where infusions with `ss`=1 caused `mrgsolve`/`R` to crash when the infusion duration was equal to or some multiple of the dosing interval. ([issue 19](../../issues/19))
* Fixed a bug where setting `F_CENT` to zero gave undefined behavior.  `mrgsolve` will issue an error if `F_CMT` is set to zero and the `ss` flag is set to 1. ([issue 22](../../issues/16))
* Fixed bug where dosing records with `evid=4` (reset the system and dose)  and `addl > 0` reset the system for all subsequent doses. Additional doses coming from records with `evid=4` will not do system reset. ([issue 23](../../issues/23))

## Important changes
* New arguments for `$NMXML` (see `?nmxml`) that are easier to understand and consistent with new prefixes and labels for `ETA` and `EPS`.  `name` argument is removed.  Use `tname` (to provide a prefix for `THETAs`), `oname` (to name the `OMEGA` matrix), and `sname` (to name the `SIGMA` matrix) instead.  In general, set `theta` to be `TRUE` to import `THETAs`, set `omega` to be `TRUE` to import `OMEGA`, and set `sigma` to be `TRUE` to import `SIGMA`.  Specifying character names `tname`, `oname`, and `sname` will imply `theta=TRUE`, `omega=TRUE`, and `sigma=TRUE`, respectively.


## New features
* New aliases available for setting bioavailability, lag time and infusion duration and rate.  For a compartment called `DEPOT` use: `F_DEPOT` (bioavailability), `ALAG_DEPOT` (dosing lag time), `D_DEPOT` (infusion duration), and / or `R_DEPOT` (infusion rate). ([issue 13](../../issues/13))
* Added *slightly* more informative messages when `DLSODA` fails, including clear identification if the value of `istate`, which is 2 when the solver succeeds and negative when the solver fails.
* Added `labels` and `prefix` options to `$OMEGA` and `$SIGMA`.  These allow descriptive aliases for ETAs ... e.g. using `ETA_CL` rather than `ETA(1)`.  ([issue 15](../../issues/15))
* Added `dplyr::slice` method for `mrgsims` objects ([issue 11](../../issues/11))
* New argument to `mread`: `quiet`.  Setting `quiet` to `TRUE` will prevent printing messages when `mread` is called.  The default is `getOptions("mrgsolve_mread_quiet",FALSE)` ... so you can call `options(mrgsolve_mread_quiet = TRUE)` to globally turn off messages from `mread`.

# Since 0.5.001

## Bugs Fixed
* Fixed paths for project (`project`) and shared object (`soloc`) so that "short" paths are used when compiling the model on Windows  platforms (info [issue 4](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/issues/4) and [here](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/wiki/Windows-issues#spaces-in-project-directory-path))
* Fixed a bug where bioavailability fraction was not accounted for when setting infusion duration in `$MAIN` with `rate=-2` (see [issue 3](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/issues/3))
* `mrgsolve_example` prints a message telling the user to use `mrgmod` to read and compile the model.  The user should use `mread`.  The message has been updated. (info [issue 5](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/issues/5))
* Fixed bug where parameters were not correctly read from first row of a data set when certain `recsort` options were selected ([issue 6](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/issues/6))

## New Features
*  Added `$ADVAN2` and `$ADVAN4` for implementing one- and two-compartment PK models with analytical solutions rather than ODEs (thanks to contributions by Bill Gillespie and Charles Margossian)
* Added `soloc` attribute added to `mrgmod` and argument added to `mread`, giving user control over where the shared object is stored; by default it is in `tempdir()`.  `soloc` needs to be set to local directory when using `qapply`
* Added generics for various `dplyr_` functions so that `mrgsims` objects can be piped to `mutate`, `group_by`, `filter`, `summarise`, `do`, `select`, and `summarise.each` (it's a dot not an underscore).  So: `mod %>% mrgsim %>% mutate(group=1)`
* You can now set initial conditions though `idata`; for compartment `CMT`, include a column in `idata` called `CMT_0`
* Modified update policy for `$OMEGA` and `$SIGMA`: if all incoming matrices are unnamed and the signature matches the model object, the update will happen
* Added `mcRNG` function as alias to `base::RNGkind("L'Ecuyer-CMRG")`

## Important changes
* Changes to `recsort`: 1 and 2 will put explicit doses after observations at the same time, 3 and 4 will put explicit doses before observations at the same time.  2 and 4 will put doses scheduled through `addl` after observations at the same time; 1 and 3 put doses scheduled through `addl` before observations at the same tile.

## Under the hood
* Changed dosing lag time mechanism so that lag times are calculated as the simulation progresses and dose times in the simulated output are as in the input data
* Model shared objects are given random names every time the model is compiled and loaded
* Various fixes and expansions to documentation
* Changed `R` dependency to `>= 3.1.2`
* All `Ops` involving `mrgmod` objects are now deprecated
* `loadso` now returns the model object (invisibly)
* Compartment names are automatically removed from table map
* Model specification files in need of compilation are detected via md5sum
* Minimum of 2 sec wait time is required before re-compiling a model
* Added `init` method with signature `mrgmod`,`ANY`, with `ANY` getting coerced to `list`
